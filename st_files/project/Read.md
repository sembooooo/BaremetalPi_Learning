### Status: 
Working code:
      1. Gpio code [Gpio.h and LED.c]
In progress code: 
      2. systick [systick.h]


Note: I have taken the help of some st provided header files and CMSIS files for learning the coding style(inline functions, typedefs' etc)  they have adopted to. 
For ease in typing i have copied and pasted some structure typedefs as they are very long to write. 


The final moto is to learn how to write a Toy Operating system by taking the help of an edx course. 
Real time bluetooth systems.
