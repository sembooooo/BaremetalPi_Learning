to know how it works please open " HOW IT WORKS " file [ in progress] 

CODE IS DEVELOPED.
Document is in progress.

i have learned how to code a basic scheduler from edx course and have introduced my own things into the code. 
The edx code is not present in this git.

Differences between the edx course code  and my code. 

1. uses two stack pointers MSP--for exceptions and PSP-- for threads
2. Even seperate stacks for threads and exceptions
3.Uses API TOY_OSCreateTask() which will assign and intiliaze the stack and will create a TCB. 

coming to license i hold nothing against this code as i have learned from EDX course and used those techiniques to create my own and a line of assembly code from Ucos as both of them are in GNU license this too holds the GNU license
