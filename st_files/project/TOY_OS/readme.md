This contains the source files necessary for toy operating system which i learned from an edx course.

The scheduler as of now is very simple and it is a round robin scheduler. 
This contains Three tasks and this scheduler should be given three tasks. 

As of now this scheduler only swtiches a task no features like Task sleep, suspend etc features are not implemented. 
This will just give a hang of the basic things that will be done by the scheduler- the context switch. 

Slowly i will be adding the some more folders where i will try to add more features into the scheduler and into the Operating system.


for the Gpio.h and Systick.h please refer to the folder ######project
