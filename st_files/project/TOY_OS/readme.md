Under development.As of now some minor rearrangements have been done in the code(creating some extra header files) 
Ihavent given any compilaton yet. But the older version worked. 
So if one can go through the trouble of resolving errors,if any , then it will work.


This contains the source files necessary for toy operating system which i learned from an edx course.

The scheduler as of now is very simple and it is a round robin scheduler. 
This contains Three tasks and this scheduler should be given three tasks. 

As of now this scheduler only swtiches a task no features like Task sleep, suspend etc features are not implemented. 
This will just give a hang of the basic things that will be done by the scheduler- the context switch. 

Slowly i will be adding the some more folders where i will try to add more features into the scheduler and into the Operating system.


for the Gpio.h and Systick.h please refer to the folder
