Disclaimer:These programs may or may not be correct and i am in a learning phase. As soon as i  correct the code and if it works i will update this read and i will mention in which folder working code is present.

for now: BaremetalPi_Learning/multi_pi/led_blink/    -----> Status gets compiled not sure whether it works or not.


first of all my thanks to Deboer for his extensive support which he gave me. He guided me in every step like a kid and as a result i was able to write this git. 
i am still in a learning phase and i will keep on updating this git.

Every information is present in that folder readme and documentation of the code
